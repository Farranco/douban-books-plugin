DoubanBooks Plugin
==================
This is a plugin designed for the [Bookpedia](http://www.bruji.com/bookpedia/) book management software for OS X.  It was originally built based on version 5.1 of Bookpedia. It can be [installed automatically by Bookpedia](bookpedia://bruji.com/download?extras/doubanbooks.zip).

The plugin searches for book data from the Chinese website [Douban](http://book.douban.com) and returns its results for entry into Bookpedia.  Douban has a fairly large database, mainly of books published in Mainland China and with data in Simplified Chinese.
